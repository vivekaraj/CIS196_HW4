Issues: No major issues except typos. Had issues with the fact that sometimes I needed to pluralize to refer to the controller and other times I needed to singularize to refer to the model. Otherwise, very smooth.

What I did: I create 2 tables, employeers (4 columns: name (string), job category (string), company (string), and email (string)) and jobseekers (3 columns: name (string), job category (string), and email (string)). I made it so that employers and jobseekers had a one-to-one relationship for the purposes of this site.
